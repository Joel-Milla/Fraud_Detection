# Fraud Detection Project

This project is focused on using logistic regression, applying learnings from a machine learning course. It aims to develop a predictive model using a [Fraudulent Transaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1) dataset, determining the probability of a transaction being fraudulent or not. The process involves training the model with a specific dataset and evaluating its performance on a separate test set.

## Features

- Model Training: Utilizes training and testing datasets to develop the model and assess the performance.
- Performance metric: Accuracy is utilized as the primary metric to evaluate the model effectiveness.
- Model comparison: Conducts a comparison between two generated models, focusing on their predictive accuracy and effectiveness.

This project, a component of a machine learning course, leverages logistic regression to identify fraudulent transactions. It aims to develop a predictive model using the Fraudulent Transactions dataset, determining the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent. The process involves training the model with a designated dataset and evaluating its performance on a separate test set.

## Setup and installation
You can see the Jupyter Notebook [here](Fraud%20Detection.ipynb) or can install it locally using the next steps:

**Prerequisite**: This project requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can find installation instructions at the [documentation](https://jupyter.org).

To set up and show the notebook locally, follow these steps:
1. Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Joel-Milla/Fraud_Detection.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the .ipynb files.
3. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`.
